## UX/UI Replica Project

This is a replica from Ironhack's UX/UI Bootcamp students project. We were asked to develop a page of their project from FIGMA using React.

Their project consists of a vaccination agenda that a user can manage it's family's vaccination, being able to check when is the next dose of a vaccine, which vaccines you or your children already got, or even look for a Community Health Center to get vaccinated. Focusing on the brazilian community since many people have difficulties following along with their vaccines.

This project was developed by a group of people from 75th Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp.
